2. Locate a speaker
3. Locate a venue
4. Coordinate Dates
5. Finalizing the Plans for the Event
6. Announcing the Event
7. Meetup Member Messages
8. Promotion of the Event
9. Set Up YouTube Live Stream
10. Coordinating Live Caption Services 
11. RSVP Deadline
12. Day of Meetup Event
13. Post Meetup Event

## Conceive of the topic or theme
A topic or theme may originate from discussion among co-organizers, member suggestions or other sources. 

Our goal is to represent a diverse mix of developer, user experience, design, testing, legal and general accessibility content. During 12 months of the year, we strive for monthly event, with a realistic goal of 10 events a year.

If you have a valid topic in mind, the next step is to find someone who can deliver an intelligent, impactful talk on that topic.

## Locate a speaker
There is never a drought on speakers, only the awareness of, or availability of good speakers.

Look for speakers locally, within our own A11YChi member community. Even within the Chicagoland area, who have never heard of our meetup community. Look for local folks who have spoken at other local meetups or other digital events. Check the Twitters for local folks who have written an engaging article on A List Apart, Medium or other online outlets.And of course, if there is a topic you'd really like to see covered, seek out a local expert on that topic.

And then, there are the national or international speakers who happen to be in town at a given time. If a speaker happens to be in town that would be a real treat for our A11YChi membership, do what's reasonably possible to make contact with them, explain our meetup and ask if they would be interested in speaking on an accessibility-related topic at our meetup. We have been blessed to date with the likes of Derek Featherstone, Marcy Sutton, Thomas Logan and Sam Joehl presenting at our meetup.

Ideally, we would strive for a local/global speaker mix of 50/50, even 70/30.

Once a speaker has provided agreement to speaker at our meetup, we need to obtain the spreakers contact information (email, phone, Twitter, etc.), the title of their talk, a broef one paragraph description of their talk, their bio, and a hi-res photo. Make sure to ask for and receive the speaker(s) pronouns (he/his, etc.). We also need to understand their availability, as this information will aid in selecting a venue.

## Locate a venue
We presently have a list on our Google Docs repository (Meetup Venues & Contacts) of venues that we either have worked with in the past or became aware of however have not used as of yet. The listing provides the capacity of each venue. 

Once a preferred venue has been determined for a given event, the venue contact should be contacted via email to see if they would be willing to host the event. Lead time is important here, as some venues host several events, and most are handled on a "first-come-first-hosted" basis.

The key is that the venue offers the bulk of what we need for our events. We have a [Venue Checklist](https://github.com/A11YChi/Venue-Checklist) that covers most of these. The most important are:
* Capacity
* Accessibility
* Audio/Visual
* Wi-Fi

### Venues and food
Some venues seemingly come with food, as they offer it as part of their venue offering. Others don't. Food is not a requirement for hosting our meetup events. However, and especially with developer events, it does appear to help attract attendees. If the venue is to provide food, they need to understand upfront our requirement for food offerings:
* We need to know upfront if food will be provided, as that information is used for promoting the event.
* Food options should be as inclusive as possible, meaning, provide for the diverse culinary needs, i.e. gluten-free, diary-free, vegetarian (no meat)/vegan (no animal products), etc.
* Food options should be properly labeled in a highly visible way.

## Coordinate Dates
Once a venue has agreed to host the event, you must coordinate the dates of availability with your venue and speaker. While this is easy and straight forward most of the time, there have been a few occasions where much back-and-forth was needed to finalize the plans.

## Finalizing the Plans for the Event
Once you have agreement with the speaker(s) and venue on the date and time for the event, it is best to summerize via email the information for both groups to ensure there is no confusion or miscommunication. Once you receive a response of confirmation, the event can be finalized.

Once a venue has agreed to host a meetup event, please verify the location, including floor. Also ask for a sentence or paragraph providing guidance to the event space once you enter the building. 

## Announcing the Event
Two weeks prior to the event, we begin promoting the event in multiple ways.

### Meetup Announcement
You first need to create the meetup event on Meetup.com.
1. Go to [meetup.com/A11YChi/](https://meetup.com/A11YChi/)
2. On the right side, select the **"Create an event"** downdrop button, and select the **"Create a New Event"** option.
![Screenshot of Meetup.com A11YChi page with red Create an event button in lower right](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/Create-Event-Button.png) 

The "Create an event" screen appears.

#### Meetup Event Title

![The meetup event title field](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/Create-Event-Title.png)

The first field is the Title. This is an up to 80 character descriptive title for the event. Shorter is better (think social media), but we must make it descriptive.

#### Meetup Date and Time

**Note:** The time listed has come under recent scrutiny and confusion. The start time is when we want everyone there. To date, this has been 15 minutes before the housekeeping announcements and 30 minutes before the fomeal presentation begins. We counter any confusionor frustration by posting the actual schedule of events on the meetup page, and in the member messages.

![The meetup event date and time](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/Create-Event-Date-Time.png)

Here, you input the event date. Time is typically 6pm, and we try to end at 8pm, so Duration would be set to 2 hours.

#### Featured Photo
![Featured Photo option](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/Create-Event-Photo.png )

A Featured Photo is important for several reasons:
* On the Meetup page, it can communicate the vibe and energy for the event.
* On social media (pickedup automatically), it can communicate the energy for the event to new people.

Consider using an image found in the [Photos section](https://www.meetup.com/a11ychi/photos/) of our meetup site. Ideally, use one that shows popularity, interest in the topic, diverse attendees, etc. If no image meets the needs, find a free to use image (no restrictions, copyright) that helps support the event. 

#### Description
![Description field](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/Create-Event-Description.png)
The description field holds all the textual information presented on the meetup.com event page. You are limited to 4000 characters (which is easily managed, except for special events, like Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD), Lightning Talks, etc.).

Information provided should include the following:
* Schedule of events: Timings for events during the meetup. Example:
  * 5:30 p.m.: Doors open
  * 6:15 p.m.: Housekeeping announcements
  * 6:30-7:30 p.m.: Presentation and Q&A
  * 7:30 p.m.: Socializing begins
  * 8:00 p.m. Socializing / Event ends
* Details/Description of the presnetation or event
* Speaker Bio





#### Where

![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/meetup-schedule-location.png "The meetup event location")

Here is where we select the location of the venue. If listed under "Recent Places," then simply select. Otherwise, enter the address in the search text input box with the label "Pick a place."

If at a large corporate organization, make sure the floor matches what the contact communicated. We have had a few mix-ups in the past.

#### What

![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/meetup-schedule-what.png "Photo for the event and the description field, allowing for 4000 characters.")

The What section prompts for an event photo and description.

For the photo, we typically use a overall crowd shot from a prior meetup event. This way, there is an expectation set on the format and environment for the event. If the topic calls for it, we may use a custom "hero" image, similar to [our April 2018 meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/a11ychi/events/247810000/).

For the description, it should following this format:

[meetup event description]
[Presenter bios]

As the event gets closer, additional information is added, such as RSVP/Waitlist handling, requests to change your RSVP if your plan change and the schedule of events.

#### Who

![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/meetup-schedule-who.png "Who is hosting the event, capacity and if members can bring guests")

The person scheduling the meetup event is the default host of the event. You can add other organizers to this list.

For number of spots available, this is directly tied into the capacity for the venue. We typically oversell events, like airlines. We have an average attendance rate over RSVPs of 40%. Therefore, it is acceptable to set the available spots to double the actual capacity. This may change in the future, or for some events. We do not wish to have more people attend than can officially be hosted in a space, as this may cause issues for the venue-sponsoring organization.

We do not want members to bring "guests" to meetup events, as most venues require a list of names of individuals on the RSVP list for building security. So ensure this is not checked.

#### Additional Settings

![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/meetup-schedule-additional-settings.png "Member question and RSVP start/end time")

The options under Additional Settings are all off by default. 

Turn on the "Ask a member a question" option. We use this field to obtain the member's legal full name, which is only used for the RSVP list that is sent to building security. The exact verbage of the member question is:

**_What is your full legal name (this information is necessary for building security only and will not be shared elsewhere)?_**

Turn on the RSVP start and end time option. This allows us to start accepting RSVPs at a later time after the meetup is announced. We typically turn off RSVPs two days prior to the event, so the venue's building security has time to enter all the names in.

Before Publishing the meetup event, you can Preview it, or simply save it as a draft. Publishing places the meetup information on the meetup's meetup.com website. However, while the meetup event is published live for the public to access, no one has been proactively informed that the meetup information is available.

To proactively push this information to meetup members, you select the "Announce this Meetup" button.

#### A Note on Announcing vs. Making RSVPs Available

Through trial and error, we have discovered that we get an improved ratio of actual attendees to RSVPs when we announce no earlier than two weeks prior to the event. This typcally allows just over a week and a half for people to RSVP. So while technically, you can publish a meetup event on the meetup.com website, you shouldn't announce the event until two weeks prior to the event.

## Meetup Member Messages
We primarily use member messages to promote upcoming meetup events. However, we also attemot to provide value by also incouding other events, news and information that may be interesting to our members.

For promotional purposes, we send 2-3 member emails out,
* the first being two weeks prior to the event
* the seecond being one week prior to the event
* a third message is potentially sent shortly before the RSVP deadline if 
  * our RSVP numbers are low
  * we are waitlisted and feel a reminder that RSVPs should be changed if plans change

To create an email message to members:
1. Navigate to the A11YChi meetup homepage.
2. On the left side, select the "Manage group" drop-down button, then select "Email members.""
3. The default setting, "All members subscribed to organizer messages" should be selected. Other options are available based on the situation.

![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/meetup-member-email.png "Member message audience targeting and subject line")

4. In the Subject text input field, enter the email message's subject. In the past, we've tended to summerarize the content in the email message.
5. Enter the member message content in the Message field.
6. Select Preview if you wish to see the message before sending it.
7. Select Submit. The member message should be received in your email inbox within a few minutes.

![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/meetup-member-email-message.png "Member email message")

*Note:* If something should happen where the email is not received within a decent timeframe, you can also send from your email client, by sending it to meetup-a11ychi-announce@meetup.com.

## Promotion of the Event
We use various methods to promote the meetup events.
* Social Media
* Chicago Tech Events
* Laura Carlson's Weekly Web Design Update Newsletter
* Eventbrite

### Social Media
This is what we primarily use to promote our local meetup events. At the same time as we announce the meetup and mesage members, we start advertising the event, with a link to the meetup event page. Twitter is the primary platform, however, LinkedIn has been used as well. Hashtags are used to target the appropriate audience. When possible, we use #chicago and/or #chicagotect. 

About four days prior to the RSVP deadline, we push the deadline information, to create a sense of urgency.

The day of the event, we post the live stream and live caption information throughout the day, up to the start of the event. We also post thank you posts on our sponsors.

### Chicago Tech Events
We post the event onto Chicago Tech Events at ![chicagotechevents.com/submit](http://chicagotechevents.com/submit).

### Laura Carlson's Weekly Web Design Update Newsletter
For events that provide a live stream and live captions, we send Laura the information prior to the Thursday before the event.

### Eventbrite
We often submit our event to ![Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/).

## Set Up YouTube Live Stream
To set up the Live Stream event on YouTube:
1. Go to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)
2. Login using the A11YChi credentials.
3. Once logged in, select the account avitar and from the dropdown menu, select Creator Studio.
4. Under Creator Studio, select Live Streaming, then Events.

![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/youtube-newevent.png "New Live Event screen")

5. Select either the New Live Event button, or Schedule a New Event link.

![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/youtube-eventinfo.png "Event Info screen")

6. Enter a Title, the beginning and ending date and time and the description used on the Meetup event page. Add tags/keywords that best related to the event topic. Make sure the event is Public. The type must be Quick (using Google Hangouts On Air).
7. Select the Create event button.

The resulting YouTube URL for this recording will be used in promoting the Live Stream for the event, as well as provide the Live Captioning service the Live Stream URL.

## Coordinating Live Caption Services 
We schedule our live captions and any other alternative communication services more than a week prior to the event. A11YChi uses Alternative Communication Services (ACS). While the business has an online form to request services, we typically contact the operations manager, Carmin Beardsley, directly via email to ensure proper scheduling.

Live captions can be provided in-person and remotely. For our meetups, we leverage remote live captioning. This requires the live streaming and supportive wi-fi to be of the highest quality. When scheduling the event with Carmin, we provide the following information:
* Date of event
* Time of event (meaning, the time of the live stream; typically 6:30pm CT)
* Name of the event
* Meetup event page URL
* YouTube Live Stream URL (see above)
Carmin will provide a confirmation with the name and contact information of the remote captioner. If confirmation is not received by the RSVP deadline date, follow-up with Carmin for confirmation.

**Note:** McDonalds sponsors the live captions for our meetup. Its best to check our balance with ACS (see Google sheet on shared Google Drive) prior to scheduling the live caption services. Remote live captions cost $100 for 60 mins. If we are running low, we need to contact Sheri at McDonalds well in advance of the event so approvals and processing can be completed.

## RSVP Deadline
For typical meetups, the RSVP deadline is 2 business days prior to the event, at 12 noon CT. The meetup event should have RSVPs turned off at this time.

At 12 noon CT on the RSVP deadline day, the list of RSVPs, plus any additional individuals that need to have access to the venue (such as interpreters, presenters, etc.). To download the RSVP list,

1. Navigate to our meetup.com homepage.
2. Select the event.
3. From the event page, select the Organizer tools drop-down, then select Manage attendees.
![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/meetup-members.png "Manage members option")
4. Select Tools, then Download attendees.
![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/meetup-members-download.png "Download members")
The list of RSVPs will be downloaded in Excel format.
5. Open the Excel file.
![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/member-attendee-excel.png "Attendee list in the downloaded Excel file")
6. Delete all columns, except for "Name" and "What is your Full Legal Name?" The latter is the RSVP question. It is not required, however, it supplements the member name, which in some cases, is not acceptable for building security. As the RSVP question is not required, some RSVP may not provide a full legal name. Those can be deleted.
![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/member-attendee-edited-01.png "Edited Attendee list")
7. Now, you must manually check between the "Name" and "What is your full legal name" columns, ensuring that the Name column has the full legal name. In the screen shot above, Alex Chen would be replaced with Allison Chen, Bonnie would be replaced with Bonnie Gabrielson, Brian C with Brian Chorba, etc.
8. Once finished with this manual editing, and adding any additional names, delete the "What is your full legal name" column. Save the file.
9. Send this file to the venue contact, labeling this the RSVP list for building security.

## Day of Meetup Event
### Items to Ensure are Brought to the Meetup Event
The following area items typically brought to the majority of meetup events. Some events do not require all items.
* Laptop with cord (for live stream)
* Lapel microphone (see below)
* Tripod (for iPad recording)
* Tripod adapter (for iPad)
* No photo lanyards
* Meetup stickers
* Wireless remote

### Live Stream Setup
The live stream setup depends on the presentation, format, etc. For a typical live stream setup, where the laptop cam is used to capture both the slides and presenter, the laptop should be placed in front of the presentation area, ensuring both the slides and presenter are visible most of the time.
