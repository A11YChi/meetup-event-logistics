6. Announcing the Event
7. Meetup Member Messages
8. Promotion of the Event
9. Set Up YouTube Live Stream
10. Coordinating Live Caption Services 
11. Day of Meetup Event
12. Post Meetup Event

## Conceive of the topic or theme
A topic or theme may originate from discussion among co-organizers, member suggestions or other sources. If you have a valid topic in mind, the next step is to find someone who can deliver an intelligent, impactful talk on that topic.
## Locate a speaker
There is never a drought on speakers, only the awareness of, or availability of good speakers.

Look for speakers locally, within our own A11YChi member community. Even within the Chicagoland area, who have never heard of our meetup community. Look for local folks who have spoken at other local meetups or other digital events. Check the Twitters for local folks who have written an engaging article on A List Apart, Medium or other online outlets.And of course, if there is a topic you'd really like to see covered, seek out a local expert on that topic.

And then, there are the national or international speakers who happen to be in town at a given time. If a speaker happens to be in town that would be a real treat for our A11YChi membership, do what's reasonably possible to make contact with them, explain our meetup and ask if they would be interested in speaking on an accessibility-related topic at our meetup. We have been blessed to date with the likes of Derek Featherstone, Marcy Sutton, Thomas Logan and Sam Joehl presenting at our meetup.

## Locate a venue
We presently have a list on our Google Docs repository (Meetup Venues & Contacts) of venues that we either have worked with in the past or became aware of however have not used as of yet. The listing provides the capacity of each venue. 

Once a preferred venue has been determined for a given event, the venue contact should be contacted via email to see if they would be willing to host the event. Lead time is important here, as some venues host several events, and most are handled on a "first-come-first-hosted" basis.

The key is that the venue offers the bulk of what we need for our events. We have a [Venue Checklist](https://github.com/A11YChi/Venue-Checklist) that covers most of these. The most important are:
* Capacity
* Accessibility
* Audio/Visual
* Wi-Fi

## Coordinate Dates
Once a venue has agreed to host the event, you must coordinate the dates of availability with your venue and speaker. While this is easy and straight forward most of the time, there have been a few occasions where much back-and-forth was needed to finalize the plans.

## Finalizing the Plans for the Event
Once you have agreement with the speaker(s) and venue on the date and time for the event, it is best to summerize via email the information for both groups to ensure there is no confusion or miscommunication. Once you receive a response of confirmation, the event can be scheduled.

### Venue Guidance
Once a preferred venue has agreed to host a meetup event, please verify the location, including floor. Also ask for a sentence or paragraph providing guidance to the event space once you enter the building. 

### Presentation Title & Description and Speaker Bio
Once the speaker(s) has agreed to present at an event, ask that they send a presentation title and description of their presentation. We also ask for a speaker biography, typically 2-3 sentences. This will be used on the Meetup event page and spoken during introductions at the actual event. 

Make sure to ask for and receive the speaker(s) pronouns (he/his, etc.)  

## Announcing the Event
Once plans for an event are finalized, announcement and promotion can begin.

Announcement takes a couple forms; Meetup Announcement and Messages to Members.

### Meetup Announcement
You first need to create the meetup event on Meetup.com.
1. Go to [meetup.com/A11YChi/](https://meetup.com/A11YChi/)
2. On the right side, select the Plan a Meetup downdrop button, and select the "Schedule a New Meetup" option.
![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/meetup-schedule-event.png "Plan an Meetup button with Schedule a New Meetup option") 

The "Schedule a Meetup" screen appears.

#### Meetup Title

![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/meetup-schedule-title.png "The meetup event title field")

The first field is the Meetup Title. This is an up to 80 character descriptive title for the event. Shorter is better (think social media), but we must make it descriptive.

#### Meetup Date and Time

![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/meetup-schedule-date-time.png "The meetup event date and time")

Here, you input the event date. Time is typically 6pm, ending at 8pm.

We leave the meetup event as being hosted "just once."

#### Where

![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/meetup-schedule-location.png "The meetup event location")

Here is where we select the location of the venue. If listed under "Recent Places," then simply select. Otherwise, enter the address in the search text input box with the label "Pick a place."

If at a large corporate organization, make sure the floor matches what the contact communicated. We have had a few mix-ups in the past.

#### What

![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/meetup-schedule-what.png "Photo for the event and the description field, allowing for 4000 characters.")

The What section prompts for an event photo and description.

For the photo, we typically use a overall crowd shot from a prior meetup event. This way, there is an expectation set on the format and environment for the event. If the topic calls for it, we may use a custom "hero" image, similar to [our April 2018 meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/a11ychi/events/247810000/).

For the description, it should following this format:

[meetup event description]
[Presenter bios]

As the event gets closer, additional information is added, such as RSVP/Waitlist handling, requests to change your RSVP if your plan change and the schedule of events.

#### Who

![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/meetup-schedule-who.png "Who is hosting the event, capacity and if members can bring guests")

The person scheduling the meetup event is the default host of the event. You can add other organizers to this list.

For number of spots available, this is directly tied into the capacity for the venue. We typically oversell events, like airlines. We have an average attendance rate over RSVPs of 40%. Therefore, it is acceptable to set the available spots to double the actual capacity. This may change in the future, or for some events. We do not wish to have more people attend than can officially be hosted in a space, as this may cause issues for the venue-sponsoring organization.

We do not want members to bring "guests" to meetup events, as most venues require a list of names of individuals on the RSVP list for building security. So ensure this is not checked.

#### Additional Settings

![alt text](https://github.com/A11YChi/meetup-event-logistics/blob/master/img/meetup-schedule-additional-settings.png "Member question and RSVP start/end time")

The options under Additional Settings are all off by default. 

Turn on the "Ask a member a question" option. We use this field to obtain the member's legal full name, which is only used for the RSVP list that is sent to building security. The exact verbage of the member question is:

**_What is your full legal name (this information is necessary for building security only and will not be shared elsewhere)?_**

Turn on the RSVP start and end time option. This allows us to start accepting RSVPs at a later time after the meetup is announced. We typically turn off RSVPs two days prior to the event, so the venue's building security has time to enter all the names in.

Before Publishing the meetup event, you can Preview it, or simply save it as a draft. Publishing places the meetup information on the meetup's meetup.com website. However, while the meetup event is published live for the public to access, no one has been proactively informed that the meetup information is available.

To proactively push this information to meetup members, you select the "Announce this Meetup" button.

#### A Note on Announcing vs. Making RSVPs Available

Through trial and error, we have discovered that we get an improved ratio of actual attendees to RSVPs when we announce no earlier than two weeks prior to the event. This typcally allows just over a week and a half for people to RSVP. So while technically, you can publish a meetup event on the meetup.com website, you shouldn't announce the event until two weeks prior to the event.

## Meetup Member Messages
We primarily use member messages to promote upcoming meetup events. However, we also attemot to provide value by also incouding other events, news and information that may be interesting to our members.

For promotional purposes, we send 2-3 member emails out, * the first being two weeks prior to the event
* the seecond being one week prior to the event
* a third message is potentially sent shortly before the RSVP deadline if 
** our RSVP numbers are low
** we are waitlisted and feel a reminder that RSVPs should be changed if plans change

## Promotion of the Event
## Set Up YouTube Live Stream
## Coordinating Live Caption Services 
## Day of Meetup Event
## Post Meetup Event
