## Conceive of the topic or theme
A topic or theme may originate from discussion among co-organizers, member suggestions or other sources. If you have a valid topic in mind, the next step is to find someone who can deliver an intelligent, impactful talk on that topic.
## Locate a speaker
There is never a drought on speakers, only the awareness of, or availability of good speakers.

Look for speakers locally, within our own A11YChi member community. Even within the Chicagoland area, who have never heard of our meetup community. Look for local folks who have spoken at other local meetups or other digital events. Check the Twitters for local folks who have written an engaging article on A List Apart, Medium or other online outlets.And of course, if there is a topic you'd really like to see covered, seek out a local expert on that topic.

And then, there are the national or international speakers who happen to be in town at a given time. If a speaker happens to be in town that would be a real treat for our A11YChi membership, do what's reasonably possible to make contact with them, explain our meetup and ask if they would be interested in speaking on an accessibility-related topic at our meetup. We have been blessed to date with the likes of Derek Featherstone, Marcy Sutton, Thomas Logan and Sam Joehl presenting at our meetup.

## Locate a venue
We presently have a list on our Google Docs repository (Meetup Venues & Contacts) of venues that we either have worked with in the past or became aware of however have not used as of yet. The listing provides the capacity of each venue. 

Once a preferred venue has been determined for a given event, the venue contact should be contacted via email to see if they would be willing to host the event. Lead time is important here, as some venues host several events, and most are handled on a "first-come-first-hosted" basis.

The key is that the venue offers the bulk of what we need for our events. We have a [Venue Checklist](https://github.com/A11YChi/Venue-Checklist) that covers most of these. The most important are:
* Capacity
* Accessibility
* Audio/Visual
* Wi-Fi

## Coordinate Dates
Once a venue has agreed to host the event, you must coordinate the dates of availability with your venue and speaker. While this is easy and straight forward most of the time, there have been a few occasions where much back-and-forth was needed to finalize the plans.

## Finalizing the Plans for the Event
Once you have agreement with the speaker(s) and venue on the date and time for the event, it is best to summerize via email the information for both groups to ensure there is no confusion or miscommunication. Once you receive a response of confirmation, the event can be scheduled.

### Venue Guidance
Once a preferred venue has agreed to host a meetup event, please verify the location, including floor. Also ask for a sentence or paragraph providing guidance to the event space once you enter the building. 

### Presentation Title & Description and Speaker Bio
Once the speaker(s) has agreed to present at an event, ask that they send a presentation title and description of their presentation. We also ask for a speaker biography, typically 2-3 sentences. This will be used on the Meetup event page and spoken during introductions at the actual event. 

Make sure to ask for and receive the speaker(s) pronouns (he/his, etc.)  

## Announcing the Event
Once plans for an event are finalized, announcement and promotion can begin.

Announcement takes a couple forms; Meetup Announcement and Messages to Members.

### Meetup Announcement
You first need to create the meetup event on Meetup.com.
1. Go to [meetup.com/A11YChi/](https://meetup.com/A11YChi/)
2. On the right side, select the Plan a Meetup downdrop button, and select the "Schedule a New Meetup" option.
